# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language processing is a branch of artificial intelligence deals with interaction between machines and humans using Natural Language.

NLP is difficult because, first the words must be understood and then they must be combined together to undertanding the underlying meaning, emotion behind it.

Syntactic analysis and Symantic analysis are the techniques used to complete NLP tasks and these techniques rely on machine learning to derive meaning from human language.

*Syntactic analysis* uses the grammatical rules on the sentence to make sense of it or to get valuable information from it and *Symantic analysis* uses words and how they are interpreted.
