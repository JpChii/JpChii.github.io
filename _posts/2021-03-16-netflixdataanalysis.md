# Netflix Programs

I use netflix a lot for my entertainment and binge watching - Usually wasting too much time by clicking suggested tv shows and moviesðŸ˜•.

Then i thought why not analyze netflix content dataset to see, if i can find any intersting stuff.

Downloaded dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) as of 2019 from kaggle and setup an conda environment with numpy, pandas and matplotlib for analysis and visualisation.

### Show/Movie `release_year` feature analysis

On Analysing the data, number of shows/movies has taken a extremley huge spike from the halfway mark in dataset. From 20 in 1980 to more than 1750 in 2020.
This increase might be owing to the addition few reasons
  * Content from different countries after the beginning of 2000's - We can confirm this by analyzing `country` further
  * Content not saved due to less technological advancements during the time period

*Plot's visualzied based on the release year seperated at midpoint*

On analysing `country` feature, there's not much correlation between year of release and number of countries. 
*On seeing the below graph the no of countries increased from a peak of 5 in first half to peak of 12 in second half which can be considered as gradual increase.* We can confirm that older movies/shows available in netflix based on released years is less in first half due to techonlogy only.

### Show/Movie `year_added` feature analysis
The contents were added to netflix from 2008. Number of shows/movies added were less from *2008 to 2010*, then a break in 2011. New content were added for the next two years i.e *2011 and 201* and nothing until 2013. From *2013 to 2016* new contents were added gradually, then the addition of new contents increased exponentially from 400(2016-2017) to 1200(2017-2018) and this pattern is observed in further years.

Based on the addition of new contents, we can say netflix subscribers could have increased from 2015 and loads of additional content were added to attract more subscribers for the platform.
