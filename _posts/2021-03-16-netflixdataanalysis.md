# Netflix Programs

I use netflix a lot for my entertainment and binge watching - Usually wasting too much time by clicking suggested tv shows and moviesðŸ˜•.

Then i thought why not analyze netflix content dataset to see, if i can find any intersting stuff.

Downloaded dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) as of 2019 from kaggle and setup an conda environment with numpy, pandas and matplotlib for analysis and visualisation.
